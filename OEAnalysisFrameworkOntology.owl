It was because of the political over-use of “M” that led to the push for a “whole-of-government” (WoG) approach within the national security apparatus; and particularly, the DoD. DIME (FIL) was added to include statecraft resources of financial, intelligence and law enforcement dynamics to be applied to the operational environments.”</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Hybrid warfare is a whole-of-government approach dominated by non-military instruments of power and therefore is predominantly political in nature. Approaches to address it require an integrated technique that extends beyond the traditional definition of “D” instruments. In the hyper-connected, globalized world, expansion of diplomatic efforts across time (“when” diplomatic instruments are applied), scale (“where”, at what level they are applied) and types of actors (“who” employs these instruments) become critical considerations.</obo:IAO_0000115>

The US in particular has been able to use its global economic cloud to deliver comprehensive multilateral sanctions by blocking access to its own market. The sanctions’ effectiveness in shaping a desired political and military outcome, especially by curtailing adversaries’ resources spent on armament, has been clearly demonstrated in Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s regime, in Libya under Gaddafi’s regime and most recently in the case of Iran.</obo:IAO_0000115>

A major downside of economic sanctions is that they generally take an extended period to influence political outcome. However, the incremental change is often worth the reward. For example, the West has experienced slight economic harm with the implementation of sanctions; however, this loss is disproportionally lower than the impact they have had on Russia, with the latter GDP shrinking by approximately 4% in 2015 alone. Furthermore, as seen in Iraq in the 1990s and in Iran in the 2010s, sanctions significantly hindered the buildup of conventional and nuclear capabilities and access to advanced technologies.</obo:IAO_0000115>

Rather than focusing on purely military means, hybrid warfare takes advantage of the modern information environment to engage in a “battle of narratives.” Though hybrid forces can employ sophisticated military capabilities, their primary tools are media reporting, the internet, “and the integration of information operations with strategic communication.”</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>To counter disinformation threats, NATO and its partner organizations need to develop procedures that will enable rapid and sweeping dissemination of such fact-based information within its populations and to the global audience at large. This relies on effective intelligence capabilities, and optimistically, the Alliance possesses powerful analytical and operational expertise in this domain. As discussed in the Networks section, NATO member states should work at local government level, with civil society groups, schools, churches and other local level actors to make the network accessible to more recipients via local news and social media outlets. The crucial coordination between civil society and other non-governmental groups can provide wider outreach, increase credibility among the public.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>If power is derived from connectivity, “then the focus of leadership should be on making connections to solve shared problems.” Different countries, organizations and stakeholders can mobilize diverse coalitions for specific purposes. The range and complexity of challenges and the speed with which a crisis can escalate means that “knowing the right people to call and the right levers to pull in any corner of the world must be a key element” of the West’s diplomacy. The ability of governments to orchestrate networks of public, private, and civic actors is key to addressing hybrid conflicts.  

For instance, in dealing with ISIS, the US has been able to stop planned attacks with a dense global network of law enforcement officers, counterterrorism officials and intelligence agencies. Similarly, public-private networks have formed across the world to counter hybrid conflict with non-military means. This includes the collaboration between technological and social media companies to block terrorist activity, as well as the between private businesses and civil society groups to address the current immigration crisis in Europe, from which some ISIS recruits originate.</obo:IAO_0000115>

A major downside of economic sanctions is that they generally take an extended period to influence political outcome. However, the incremental change is often worth the reward. For example, the West has experienced slight economic harm with the implementation of sanctions; however, this loss is disproportionally lower than the impact they have had on Russia, with the latter GDP shrinking by approximately 4% in 2015 alone. Furthermore, as seen in Iraq in the 1990s and in Iran in the 2010s, sanctions significantly hindered the buildup of conventional and nuclear capabilities and access to advanced technologies.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>To counter disinformation threats, NATO and its partner organizations need to develop procedures that will enable rapid and sweeping dissemination of such fact-based information within its populations and to the global audience at large. This relies on effective intelligence capabilities, and optimistically, the Alliance possesses powerful analytical and operational expertise in this domain. As discussed in the Networks section, NATO member states should work at local government level, with civil society groups, schools, churches and other local level actors to make the network accessible to more recipients via local news and social media outlets. The crucial coordination between civil society and other non-governmental groups can provide wider outreach, increase credibility among the public.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>If power is derived from connectivity, “then the focus of leadership should be on making connections to solve shared problems.” Different countries, organizations and stakeholders can mobilize diverse coalitions for specific purposes. The range and complexity of challenges and the speed with which a crisis can escalate means that “knowing the right people to call and the right levers to pull in any corner of the world must be a key element” of the West’s diplomacy. The ability of governments to orchestrate networks of public, private, and civic actors is key to addressing hybrid conflicts.  

For instance, in dealing with ISIS, the US has been able to stop planned attacks with a dense global network of law enforcement officers, counterterrorism officials and intelligence agencies. Similarly, public-private networks have formed across the world to counter hybrid conflict with non-military means. This includes the collaboration between technological and social media companies to block terrorist activity, as well as the between private businesses and civil society groups to address the current immigration crisis in Europe, from which some ISIS recruits originate.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

At a minimum, the goal of EW is to control the use of the electromagnetic spectrum at critical locations and times or to attack a specific system. To accomplish these EW goals and objectives, actors can employ both lethal and nonlethal measures. Lethal EW activities include the physical destruction of high-priority targets supporting another actor’s decisionmaking process—such as reconnaissance sensors, command posts, and communications systems. They also include activities such as lethal air defense suppression measures. If available, precision munitions can degrade or eliminate high-technology C2 assets and associated links. Nonlethal EW means range from signals reconnaissance and electronic jamming to the deployment of protective countermeasures and deception jammers. Sophisticated camouflage, deception, decoy, or mockup systems can degrade the effects of enemy reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) systems. Also, an actor can employ low-cost GPS jammers to disrupt another actor’s precision munitions targeting, sensor-to-shooter links, and navigation. (FM 7-100.1)</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>The 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). Article 2, defines genocide as: &quot;any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.” 

To commit genocide, the perpetrators need a strong, centralized authority and bureaucratic organization as well as pathological individuals and criminals. Also required is a campaign of vilification and dehumanization of the victims by the perpetrators, who are usually new states or new regimes attempting to impose conformity to a new ideology and its model of society. Examples of recent acts of genocide are Rwanda, Former Yugoslavia, and Sudan.</obo:IAO_0000115>

The most widely recognized international documentation of human rights is the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which has been ratified by the majority of the world’s nations. However, many nations still struggle or refuse to implement all of the provisions of this declaration.

(FM 3-0). It employs both staff management and automatic processes to focus a vast array of information and make relevant information available to the right person at the right time. Effective information management—synchronized with reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) operations—enables commanders to gain and maintain information superiority. The level of Information management is defined by management, systems, and security. The three are intertwined and are therefore addressed as a composite capability in this subvariable. Information Systems: The equipment and facilities that collect, process, store, display and disseminate information. This includes computers—hardware and software—and communications, as well as policies and procedures for their use. (FM 30) Information systems and information management appear similar because they are intertwined. The sophistication of the information systems largely determines the capability of military command and control (C2) and civil interconnectivity. Information Security: The protection of information and information systems against unauthorized access or modification of information, whether in storage, processing, or transit, and against denial of services to authorized users. (JP 3-13) Information security includes those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.

Enemy or foreign audiences, as well as the local population, may be targets of perception management. Perception management can include misinformation, media manipulation, and psychological warfare. (FM 7-100.1) 
Psychological warfare (PSYWAR) is the capability and activities designed to influence selected friendly, neutral, and/or hostile target audiences’ attitudes and behaviors in support of the actor. PSYWAR can target either specific decisionmaking systems or the entire information system of the target audience, while influencing key communicators and decisionmakers. Such attacks target an enemy’s perceived centers of gravity. For example, prolonging an operation and using all forms of media to show the devastation of conflict can sway public opinion against the effort. (FM 7-100.1) Many actors skillfully employ media and other neutral actors, such as NGOs, to influence further public and private perceptions. Actors can exploit the international media’s willingness to report information without independent and timely confirmation. Individuals such as agents of influence, sympathizers, and antiwar protesters are also employed advantageously to influence the enemy’s media, politicians, and citizenry.

Protection and security measures conducted as part of INFOWAR include -

• Information collection, processing, and utilization. 
• Reconnaissance and counterreconnaissance. 
• Information and operations security. 
• Camouflage, concealment, cover, and deception. 
• Force protection. 
• Secure use of information-collection and –processing systems. An actor’s capability against its main opponent can come from a high-tech asset or a low-tech approach. (FM 7-100.1)</obo:IAO_0000115>

The amount of water vapor the air actually contains compared with the maximum it can hold at a given temperature and pressure is termed the relative humidity of the air. Relative humidity is an important metric used in forecasting weather. Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. High humidity makes soldiers feel hotter outside in the summer because it reduces the effectiveness of sweating to cool the body by preventing the evaporation or perspiration from the skin. An accurate measurement of this effect is called the Wet-Bulb-Glove-Temperature (WBGT) Index, which is calculated using a combination of temperature, humidity and wind. WBGT reports are obtained from supporting combat medical units.</obo:IAO_0000115>

Slaves are held against their will from the time of their capture, purchase, or birth, and are deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to receive compensation (such as wages). 

Evidence of slavery predates written records, and has existed to varying extents, forms and periods in almost all cultures and continents. In some societies, slavery existed as a legal institution or socio-economic system, but today it is formally outlawed in nearly all countries. Nevertheless, the practice continues in various forms around the world. Freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized human right. Article 4 of the UDHR states: “No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.”</obo:IAO_0000115>

It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.” 

Torture is widely considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Signatories of the Third Geneva Convention and Fourth Geneva Convention officially agree not to torture prisoners in armed conflicts. Torture is also prohibited by the UN Convention Against Torture, which has been ratified by 145 states. However, Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some openly.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be the most disruptive technology of our time: much of today’s “thought” is artificial, vice human.  Breakthroughs in AI and deep learning enable reasoning intelligent systems that, though not sentient, administer and optimize a great many aspects of modern life.  Advanced physio-mechanical interfaces enable humanmachine integration to include optimized searching of massive indexes of data, direct access to large-scale computing power, and life-like experiences through virtual reality. The revolutionary impact of “trans-humanism” challenges the very definition of “human” – with profound ethical dilemmas that remain unresolved. Big data techniques interrogate massive databases to discover hidden patterns and correlations that form the basis of modern advertising – and are continually leveraged for intelligence and security purposes by nation states and non-state entities alike.  Quantum computing, first applied to encryption functions, is now a key computing enabler, especially for artificial intelligence.9  A mature Internet of Things connects and integrates the devices of the information realm with formerly inert objects – structures, motors, or appliances -- of the physical realm.  Neuroscience has enhanced our understanding of brain function, including neural plasticity, and has enabled advanced techniques for human-machine interfacing. A better understanding of the machinery of the mind has found commercial application in the acceleration of speed and retention in learning.  In the most connected and wealthy parts of the world, cell phones and computers will all but disappear as physical, hand held devices.  Select individuals will directly connect to cyberspace through neural implants or augmented reality systems painted directly on a retina.  If we have not yet reached the “singularity”, where AI and machines are capable of outperforming the human mind, we will nonetheless have reached a point where AI, machines, and man-machine teaming open new possibilities in this realm.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>Singularity is the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds the collective intelligence of mankind, which will radically and irrevocably change the relationship between man and machine.  There are several divergent possibilities regarding the singularity: 

 As optimistic singularity advocates, such as Ray Kurzweil have suggested, AI improves human life in every way, from healthcare, to emotional evolution, to intergalactic space travel. 

 While not entirely apocalyptic, unboxed general artificial superintelligence improves and evolves at such an exponential rate it escapes human restrictions, perspectives, and morality.  It threatens the very existence of humanity. 

 Humans evolve their own cognitive abilities through learning developments, brain implants, artificial stimulants, and non-AI high performance computing to match, or at least keep pace with AI. 

AI has the capacity to change paradigms, revolutionize everyday life, and take mankind to exciting new horizons.  However, it also may be capable of incredible destruction, malice, and lines of thinking and decision-making that are dangerous to mankind.  This duality will be critical as actors develop military applications for AI.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Humanity will become richer, older, more urban, and better educated, but the uneven distribution of this progress will accelerate tension and conflict.  The convergence of more information and more people with fewer state resources will constrain governments’ efforts to address rampant poverty, violence, and pollution, and create a breeding ground for dissatisfaction among increasingly aware, yet still disempowered populations. These factors will be attenuated by a changing climate, which has the potential to create additional crises and discontent.  The addition of over seven billion people over the last century has altered geography itself, and cities now sprawl over large areas of the globe and contain almost two-thirds of the world’s population. These numbers will only increase.  Some megacities will become more important politically and economically than the nationstate in which they reside.  Life will become both easier and more complex, with those able to take advantage of the leading edge of technological advancement increasingly exploiting those who cannot.  New social stresses and fractures will lead to strife and population migrations, which in turn create further challenges for urbanized areas.  Furthermore, the move of large numbers of people to large urban areas and megacities will strain resources, as these area will become increasingly reliant on rural areas for food, water, and even additional power.  From a military perspective, cities represent challenges, opportunities, and unique vulnerabilities.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Although AI and its associated technologies will shatter many industries and livelihoods, a wide range of advances continue to create new sources of wealth and economic development – while also significantly impacting the strategic security environment. Robotics and autonomous systems will underpin the smooth functioning of advanced societies.  Additive manufacturing, computer-aided design and millions of industrial robots will dislocate significant portions of the global supply chain.  Virtually anyone in the world with access to a computer system and 3D printer will be able to “print” anything from drones to weapons.  Encrypted blockchains will be massively disruptive to commerce functions. Together with robotics, autonomy, and AI they comprise a perfect storm for “blue collar” and “white collars” alike, causing vast economic displacement as formerly high-quality information technology and management jobs follow the previous path of agricultural and manufacturing labor.  Militaries, paramilitaries, mercenary groups, criminal elements, and even extremists groups all will be able to take advantage of this potential pool of manpower.  Biotechnology will see major advances, with many chemical and materials industry being replaced or augmented by a “bio-based economy” in which precision genetic engineering allows for bulk chemical production.  Individualized genetics enable precise performance enhancements for cognition, health, longevity, and fitness.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000119>The military research laboratories have demonstrated that high power
microwave technologies can produce significant effects, ranging from upsetting
to destroying the electronics within military and commercial systems.
The Air Force has led this technology development, and various operational
communities, including the Air Combat Command and U.S. Strategic
Command, have identified numerous offensive and defensive requirements
that can be satisfied by high power microwave weapons.

Several high power microwave technologies have matured to the point
where they are now ready for the transition from engineering and manufacturing
development to deployment as operational weapons. The conclusion
of this study is that high power microwave technology is ready for the transition
to active weapons in the U.S. military. It reviews various applications of high power microwave weapons in strategic and operational missions for
the Air Force, considers the implications of the integration of microwave
technology into operational weapons, and examines numerous constraints
and challenges associated with the transition of new technologies and systems
into the Air Force inventory.</obo:IAO_0000119>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Although more human beings stress available resources, population growth has also compounded the rate of innovation and technology development.  Human creativity is now clearly the most transformative force in the world, both enhancing human life, but also upending it, and – at times – precipitating catastrophic, disruptive events.  Information technology will continue to improve exponentially, and most of the developed world already is instrumented in some way.  Nearly every person on Earth has access to a connected, mobile device.  Advanced material capabilities have, and will continue to extend the trend of reduced size, weight, and power requirements, as nanomaterials, metamaterials, and bespoke structures allow multifunctional assemblies, vastly improving overall systems integration, reliability, and performance.  Advanced materials also foster increases in battery power and performance, allowing large amounts of power to be stored across a distributed grid, and miniaturized storage powers mobile robotics and vehicles of all types</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>Singularity is the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds the collective intelligence of mankind, which will radically and irrevocably change the relationship between man and machine.  There are several divergent possibilities regarding the singularity: 

 As optimistic singularity advocates, such as Ray Kurzweil have suggested, AI improves human life in every way, from healthcare, to emotional evolution, to intergalactic space travel. 

 While not entirely apocalyptic, unboxed general artificial superintelligence improves and evolves at such an exponential rate it escapes human restrictions, perspectives, and morality.  It threatens the very existence of humanity. 

 Humans evolve their own cognitive abilities through learning developments, brain implants, artificial stimulants, and non-AI high performance computing to match, or at least keep pace with AI. 

AI has the capacity to change paradigms, revolutionize everyday life, and take mankind to exciting new horizons.  However, it also may be capable of incredible destruction, malice, and lines of thinking and decision-making that are dangerous to mankind.  This duality will be critical as actors develop military applications for AI.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be the most disruptive technology of our time: much of today’s “thought” is artificial, vice human.  Breakthroughs in AI and deep learning enable reasoning intelligent systems that, though not sentient, administer and optimize a great many aspects of modern life.  Advanced physio-mechanical interfaces enable humanmachine integration to include optimized searching of massive indexes of data, direct access to large-scale computing power, and life-like experiences through virtual reality. The revolutionary impact of “trans-humanism” challenges the very definition of “human” – with profound ethical dilemmas that remain unresolved. Big data techniques interrogate massive databases to discover hidden patterns and correlations that form the basis of modern advertising – and are continually leveraged for intelligence and security purposes by nation states and non-state entities alike.  Quantum computing, first applied to encryption functions, is now a key computing enabler, especially for artificial intelligence.9  A mature Internet of Things connects and integrates the devices of the information realm with formerly inert objects – structures, motors, or appliances -- of the physical realm.  Neuroscience has enhanced our understanding of brain function, including neural plasticity, and has enabled advanced techniques for human-machine interfacing. A better understanding of the machinery of the mind has found commercial application in the acceleration of speed and retention in learning.  In the most connected and wealthy parts of the world, cell phones and computers will all but disappear as physical, hand held devices.  Select individuals will directly connect to cyberspace through neural implants or augmented reality systems painted directly on a retina.  If we have not yet reached the “singularity”, where AI and machines are capable of outperforming the human mind, we will nonetheless have reached a point where AI, machines, and man-machine teaming open new possibilities in this realm.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Soldiers operate in environments that are highly dynamic, increasingly complex, and physically demanding. Therefore, both their physical and cognitive burden must be mitigated while maintaining overmatch. ARL&apos;s research in the area of augmentation aims to reduce the effects of burden and exploit technological and scientific advances in the field of capability enhancement while ensuring that the augmentation adapts to the Soldier instead of requiring the Soldier to adapt to the augmentation. Augmentation focuses on enabling superhuman performance and increasing resilience during sustained activities in both training and operational domains. Though interconnected, performance enhancement and resilience enhancement are distinct areas of research. Innovations in cognitive and physical augmentation systems that are matched to individual capabilities and accommodate the operational environment are expected to significantly impact warfighter situational awareness, physical prowess and decision making. Innovations are also expected to enhance warfighter physical capabilities by balancing load and improving protection and performance.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>The impact of the development of so many new and potential revolutionary technologies is made all the more disruptive by the convergence phenomenon.  Virtually every new technology is connected and intersecting to other new technologies and advances.  The example of the contemporary “smart phone”, which connects advances in cellular telephones with a camera, gaming, miniaturized computing and the Internet has completely transformed, and in many ways disrupted contemporary life.   Future convergences between various technological advances are likely to be equally disruptive and equally unpredictable, but the areas in which we foresee the most likely convergences are: 

 Biology and bio-engineering, to include optimizing human performance 

 Neurologic enhancement 

 Nanotechnology 

 Advanced Material Sciences 

 Quantum Computing 

 Artificial Intelligence 

 Robotics 

 Additive Manufacturing</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>The timeframe of 2017-2035, which relates to a period where our adversaries can take advantage of new technologies, involves new doctrine and revised strategic concepts to effectively challenge U.S. military forces across multiple domains. Our adversaries in some cases will have superior, or near equal capabilities bolstered by advantages in time, space, and perception, and when employed effectively – often in a hybrid and multidomain fashion – they can prevail over a U.S.-led force.  The Era of Accelerated Human Progress represents an evolutionary movement rooted in the present, but clearly advancing to a new state of affairs.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>The timeframe of 2035-2050 is a period marked by significant breakthroughs in technology and convergences in terms of capabilities, which lead to significant changes in the character of warfare.  During this period, traditional aspects of warfare undergo dramatic, almost revolutionary changes which at the end of this timeframe may even challenge the very nature of warfare itself. In this era, no one actor is likely to have any long-term strategic or technological advantage, with aggregate power between the U.S. and its peer and near-peer rivals being equivalent, but not necessarily symmetric.  Prevailing in this period will depend on an ability to synchronize multi-domain capabilities against an artificial intelligence-enhanced adversary with an overarching capability to visualize and understand the battlespace at even greater ranges and velocities.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Fault Lines Analysis provides the command with an understanding of the most exploitable sources of instability in the OE. The Fault Lines Analysis Methodology is based on co-created analysis:  research and analysis conducted as a team. There are 3 distinct stages to the team research and analysis process:  Analysis 1 (A1), Analysis (A2), and Analysis 3 (A3). A1 reviews and develops categories from source text by assigning relevant words, phrases or labels to significant portions of the text.  These categories become the foundation for early analysis.  A2 organizes the categories around themes based on the relationship of ideas developed from the comparisons and analytic memos. A3 generates plausible explanations and responses to the research question (becoming assumptions or hypotheses tested in the next stage).  Each analysis stage builds on the analysis of the previous stage(s). The evolution of sound analytic explanation occurs through a systematic and defensible inductive research process. The independent stages are inductively generated to be later deductively tested by a pool of SMEs in an OE.  GCKN is available to assist with the research process.</obo:IAO_0000115>

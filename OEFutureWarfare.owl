        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(1)

Population aging is a shift in the distribution of a country&apos;s population towards older ages. This is usually reflected in an increase in the population&apos;s mean and median ages, a decline in the proportion of the population composed of children, and a rise in the proportion of the population composed of elderly.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

Shifts in a country’s age structure over time can have important implications for a country’s economic and social trajectory, as well as its resource allocations and policy agendas. For example, many countries in the world are experiencing—and will continue to experience—steady increases in the number of older adults, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the total population. This trend poses challenges for countries in balancing the pension, health, and other benefits that older adults typically receive with investments in the well-being of younger generations. In addition, some countries may choose to incentivize older adults to remain in the work force longer.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and growth hormones in industrial meat production. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, fungi and eggs.

...

From the twentieth century, intensive agriculture increased productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Critics of immigration, populist and otherwise, view it as posing unfair economic competition: whether [skilled workers], undocumented domestic and service workers, or the undercutting of wages and job availability. In addition, populist parties (among others) often charge that immigrants overuse and strain the welfare states of recipient countries.

...

One of the critical concerns of populist parties is protecting “the people” or “the nation,” defined in historical and homogenous terms. Populist parties frequently criticize immigrant and minority populations for diluting and undermining “the people” and their  well-being: in other words, these populations are a cultural threat to historical identities. At the same time, there is a broader concern with the integration of immigration populations.

Contracts to supply a given country&apos;s military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance.

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be the most disruptive technology of our time: much of today’s “thought” is artificial, vice human.  Breakthroughs in AI and deep learning enable reasoning intelligent systems that, though not sentient, administer and optimize a great many aspects of modern life.  Advanced physio-mechanical interfaces enable humanmachine integration to include optimized searching of massive indexes of data, direct access to large-scale computing power, and life-like experiences through virtual reality. The revolutionary impact of “trans-humanism” challenges the very definition of “human” – with profound ethical dilemmas that remain unresolved. Big data techniques interrogate massive databases to discover hidden patterns and correlations that form the basis of modern advertising – and are continually leveraged for intelligence and security purposes by nation states and non-state entities alike.  Quantum computing, first applied to encryption functions, is now a key computing enabler, especially for artificial intelligence.9  A mature Internet of Things connects and integrates the devices of the information realm with formerly inert objects – structures, motors, or appliances -- of the physical realm.  Neuroscience has enhanced our understanding of brain function, including neural plasticity, and has enabled advanced techniques for human-machine interfacing. A better understanding of the machinery of the mind has found commercial application in the acceleration of speed and retention in learning.  In the most connected and wealthy parts of the world, cell phones and computers will all but disappear as physical, hand held devices.  Select individuals will directly connect to cyberspace through neural implants or augmented reality systems painted directly on a retina.  If we have not yet reached the “singularity”, where AI and machines are capable of outperforming the human mind, we will nonetheless have reached a point where AI, machines, and man-machine teaming open new possibilities in this realm.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Singularity is the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds the collective intelligence of mankind, which will radically and irrevocably change the relationship between man and machine.  There are several divergent possibilities regarding the singularity: 

 As optimistic singularity advocates, such as Ray Kurzweil have suggested, AI improves human life in every way, from healthcare, to emotional evolution, to intergalactic space travel. 

 While not entirely apocalyptic, unboxed general artificial superintelligence improves and evolves at such an exponential rate it escapes human restrictions, perspectives, and morality.  It threatens the very existence of humanity. 

 Humans evolve their own cognitive abilities through learning developments, brain implants, artificial stimulants, and non-AI high performance computing to match, or at least keep pace with AI. 

AI has the capacity to change paradigms, revolutionize everyday life, and take mankind to exciting new horizons.  However, it also may be capable of incredible destruction, malice, and lines of thinking and decision-making that are dangerous to mankind.  This duality will be critical as actors develop military applications for AI.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Authoritarianism [is the] principle of blind submission to authority, as opposed to individual freedom of thought and action. In government, authoritarianism denotes any political system that concentrates power in the hands of a leader or a small elite that is not constitutionally responsible to the body of the people. Authoritarian leaders often exercise power arbitrarily and without regard to existing bodies of law, and they usually cannot be replaced by citizens choosing freely among various competitors in elections. The freedom to create opposition political parties or other alternative political groupings with which to compete for power with the ruling group is either limited or nonexistent in authoritarian regimes.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.ontologylibrary.mil/OperationalEnvironment/Mid/OEFutureWarfareOntology#BigDataRole"/>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>The Big Data Application Provider executes the manipulations of the data life cycle to meet requirements established by the System Orchestrator. This is where the general capabilities within the Big Data framework are combined to produce the specific data system. While the activities of an application provider are the same whether the solution being built concerns Big Data or not, the methods and techniques have changed because the data and data processing is parallelized across resources.

The Big Data Application Provider role executes a specific set of operations along the data life cycle to meet the requirements established by the System Orchestrator, as well as meeting security and privacy requirements. The Big Data Application Provider is the architecture component that encapsulates the business logic and functionality to be executed by the architecture. The Big Data Application Provider activities include the following:
- Collection
- Preparation
- Analytics
- Visualization
- Access</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <rdfs:comment>In general, the collection activity of the Big Data Application Provider handles the interface with the Data Provider. This may be a general service, such as a file server or web server configured by the System Orchestrator to accept or perform specific collections of data, or it may be an application-specific service designed to pull data or receive pushes of data from the Data Provider. Since this activity is receiving data at a minimum, it must store/buffer the received data until it is persisted through the Big Data Framework Provider. This persistence need not be to physical media but may simply be to an in-memory queue or other service provided by the processing frameworks of the Big Data Framework Provider. The collection activity is likely where the extraction portion of the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)/Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) cycle is performed. At the initial collection stage, sets of data (e.g., data records) of similar structure are collected (and combined), resulting in uniform security, policy, and other considerations. Initial metadata is created (e.g., subjects with keys are identified) to facilitate subsequent aggregation or look-up methods. 

The preparation activity is where the transformation portion of the ETL/ELT cycle is likely performed, although analytics activity will also likely perform advanced parts of the transformation. Tasks performed by this activity could include data validation (e.g., checksums/hashes, format checks), cleansing (e.g., eliminating bad records/fields), outlier removal, standardization, reformatting, or encapsulating. This activity is also where source data will frequently be persisted to archive storage in the Big Data Framework Provider and provenance data will be verified or attached/associated. Verification or attachment may include optimization of data through manipulations (e.g., deduplication) and indexing to optimize the analytics process. This activity may also aggregate data from different Data Providers, leveraging metadata keys to create an expanded and enhanced data set. 

The analytics activity of the Big Data Application Provider includes the encoding of the low-level business logic of the Big Data system (with higher-level business process logic being encoded by the System Orchestrator). The activity implements the techniques to extract knowledge from the data based
on the requirements of the vertical application. The requirements specify the data processing algorithms for processing the data to produce new insights that will address the technical goal. The analytics activity will leverage the processing frameworks to implement the associated logic. This typically involves the
activity providing software that implements the analytic logic to the batch and/or streaming elements of  the processing framework for execution. The messaging/communication framework of the Big Data Framework Provider may be used to pass data or control functions to the application logic running in the
processing frameworks. The analytic logic may be broken up into multiple modules to be executed by the processing frameworks which communicate, through the messaging/communication framework, with each other and other functions instantiated by the Big Data Application Provider. 

The visualization activity of the Big Data Application Provider prepares elements of the processed data and the output of the analytic activity for presentation to the Data Consumer. The objective of this activity is to format and present data in such a way as to optimally communicate meaning and knowledge. The visualization preparation may involve producing a text-based report or rendering the analytic results as some form of graphic. The resulting output may be a static visualization and may simply be stored through the Big Data Framework Provider for later access. However, the visualization activity frequently interacts with the access activity, the analytics activity, and the Big Data Framework Provider (processing and platform) to provide interactive visualization of the data to the Data Consumer based on parameters provided to the access activity by the Data Consumer. The visualization activity may be completely application-implemented, leverage one or more application libraries, or may use specialized visualization processing frameworks within the Big Data Framework Provider.

The access activity within the Big Data Application Provider is focused on the communication/interaction with the Data Consumer. Similar to the collection activity, the access activity may be a generic service such as a web server or application server that is configured by the System Orchestrator to handle specific
requests from the Data Consumer. This activity would interface with the visualization and analytic activities to respond to requests from the Data Consumer (who may be a person) and uses the processing and platform frameworks to retrieve data to respond to Data Consumer requests. In addition, the access
activity confirms that descriptive and administrative metadata and metadata schemes are captured and maintained for access by the Data Consumer and as data is transferred to the Data Consumer. The interface with the Data Consumer may be synchronous or asynchronous in nature and may use a pull or
push paradigm for data transfer.</rdfs:comment>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>The Big Data Framework Provider has general resources or services to be used by the Big Data Application Provider in the creation of the specific application. There are many new components from which the Big Data Application Provider can choose in using these resources and the network to build the specific system. This is the role that has seen the most significant changes because of Big Data. The Big
Data Framework Provider consists of one or more instances of the three subcomponents: infrastructure frameworks, data platforms, and processing frameworks. There is no requirement that all instances at a given level in the hierarchy be of the same technology and, in fact, most Big Data implementations are hybrids combining multiple technology approaches. These provide flexibility and can meet the complete range of requirements that are driven from the Big Data Application Provider. Due to the rapid emergence of new techniques, this is an area that will continue to need discussion.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A Cabinet is a body of high-ranking state officials, typically consisting of the top leaders of the executive branch. Members of a cabinet are usually called Cabinet ministers or secretaries. The function of a Cabinet varies: in some countries it is a collegiate decision-making body with collective responsibility, while in others it may function either as a purely advisory body or an assisting institution to a decision making head of state or head of government. Cabinets are typically the body responsible for the day-to-day management of the government and response to sudden events, whereas the legislative and judicial branches work in a measured pace, in sessions according to lengthy procedures.

In some countries, particularly those that use a parliamentary system...the Cabinet collectively decides the government&apos;s direction, especially in regard to legislation passed by the parliament. In countries with a presidential system...the Cabinet does not function as a collective legislative influence; rather, their primary role is as an official advisory council to the head of government. In this way, the President obtains opinions and advice relating to forthcoming decisions.

...

The second role of cabinet officials is to administer executive branches, government agencies, or departments....Cabinets are also important originators for legislation. Cabinets and ministers are usually in charge of the preparation of proposed legislation in the ministries before it is passed to the parliament. Thus, often the majority of new legislation actually originates from the cabinet and its ministries.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A civil war, also known as an intrastate war...is a war between organized groups within the same state or country. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies.

A civil war is a high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of casualties and the consumption of significant resources. Most modern civil wars involve intervention by outside powers.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Humanity will become richer, older, more urban, and better educated, but the uneven distribution of this progress will accelerate tension and conflict.  The convergence of more information and more people with fewer state resources will constrain governments’ efforts to address rampant poverty, violence, and pollution, and create a breeding ground for dissatisfaction among increasingly aware, yet still disempowered populations. These factors will be attenuated by a changing climate, which has the potential to create additional crises and discontent.  The addition of over seven billion people over the last century has altered geography itself, and cities now sprawl over large areas of the globe and contain almost two-thirds of the world’s population. These numbers will only increase.  Some megacities will become more important politically and economically than the nationstate in which they reside.  Life will become both easier and more complex, with those able to take advantage of the leading edge of technological advancement increasingly exploiting those who cannot.  New social stresses and fractures will lead to strife and population migrations, which in turn create further challenges for urbanized areas.  Furthermore, the move of large numbers of people to large urban areas and megacities will strain resources, as these area will become increasingly reliant on rural areas for food, water, and even additional power.  From a military perspective, cities represent challenges, opportunities, and unique vulnerabilities.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Singularity is the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds the collective intelligence of mankind, which will radically and irrevocably change the relationship between man and machine.  There are several divergent possibilities regarding the singularity: 

 As optimistic singularity advocates, such as Ray Kurzweil have suggested, AI improves human life in every way, from healthcare, to emotional evolution, to intergalactic space travel. 

 While not entirely apocalyptic, unboxed general artificial superintelligence improves and evolves at such an exponential rate it escapes human restrictions, perspectives, and morality.  It threatens the very existence of humanity. 

 Humans evolve their own cognitive abilities through learning developments, brain implants, artificial stimulants, and non-AI high performance computing to match, or at least keep pace with AI. 

AI has the capacity to change paradigms, revolutionize everyday life, and take mankind to exciting new horizons.  However, it also may be capable of incredible destruction, malice, and lines of thinking and decision-making that are dangerous to mankind.  This duality will be critical as actors develop military applications for AI.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>In general, corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit. Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries. Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most commonplace in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states and mafia states.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A Data Provider makes data available to itself or to others. In fulfilling its role, the Data Provider creates an abstraction of various types of data sources (such as raw data or data previously transformed by another system) and makes them available through different functional interfaces. The actor fulfilling this role can be part of the Big Data system, internal to the organization in another system, or external to the organization orchestrating the system. While the concept of a Data Provider is not new, the greater data collection and analytics capabilities have opened up new possibilities for providing valuable data.

The Data Provider role introduces new data or information feeds into the Big Data system for discovery, access, and transformation by the Big Data system. New data feeds are distinct from the data already in use by the system and residing in the various system repositories. Similar technologies can be used to access both new data feeds and existing data. The Data Provider actors can be anything from a sensor, to a human inputting data manually, to another Big Data system.

The Data Provider exposes a collection of interfaces (or services) for discovering and accessing the data. These interfaces would typically include a registry so that applications can locate a Data Provider, identify the data of interest it contains, understand the types of access allowed, understand the types of analysis supported, locate the data source, determine data access methods, identify the data security requirements, identify the data privacy requirements, and other pertinent information. Therefore, the interface would provide the means to register the data source, query the registry, and identify a standard set of data contained by the registry.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

The convergence of more information and more people with fewer state resources will constrain governments’ efforts to address rampant poverty, violence, and pollution, and create a breeding ground for dissatisfaction among increasingly aware, yet still disempowered populations. These factors will be attenuated by a changing climate, which has the potential to create additional crises and discontent.  The addition of over seven billion people over the last century has altered geography itself, and cities now sprawl over large areas of the globe and contain almost two-thirds of the world’s population. These numbers will only increase.  Some megacities will become more important politically and economically than the nationstate in which they reside.  Life will become both easier and more complex, with those able to take advantage of the leading edge of technological advancement increasingly exploiting those who cannot.  New social stresses and fractures will lead to strife and population migrations, which in turn create further challenges for urbanized areas.  Furthermore, the move of large numbers of people to large urban areas and megacities will strain resources, as these area will become increasingly reliant on rural areas for food, water, and even additional power.  From a military perspective, cities represent challenges, opportunities, and unique vulnerabilities.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of elections and civil liberties; proclamation of a state of emergency; rule by decree; repression of political opponents; not abiding by the rule of law procedures, and cult of personality. Dictatorships are often one-party or dominant-party states.

A wide variety of leaders coming to power in different kinds of regimes, such as military juntas, one-party states, dominant-party states, and civilian governments under a personal rule, have been described as dictators.

Growth is usually calculated in real terms - i.e., inflation-adjusted terms – to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of goods produced. Measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting. Since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product (GDP), it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure. The economic growth rates of nations are commonly compared using the ratio of the GDP to population or per-capita income.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, saving, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various vote counting systems and ballot types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either proportional or majoritarian. Among the former are party-list proportional representation and additional member system. Among the latter are First Past the Post electoral system (relative majority) and absolute majority. Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as approval voting, single transferable vote, instant runoff voting or a Condorcet method; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.

While openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter&apos;s ballot are usually an important exception. The secret ballot is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Discrimination in employment and occupation means treating people differently or less favourably because of characteristics that are not related to their merit or the inherent requirements of the job.

...

Discrimination can arise in a variety of work-related activities. These include access to employment, to particular occupations, promotions and to training and vocational guidance. Moreover, it can occur with respect to the terms and conditions of the employment....

...

Non-discrimination in employment means simply that employees are selected on the basis of their ability to do the job and that there is no distinction, exclusion or preference made on other grounds. Employees who experience discrimination at work are denied opportunities and have their basic human rights infringed.

...

Discrimination can take many forms, both in terms of gaining access to employment and in the treatment of employees once they are in work.
...

Most commonly, however, discrimination is indirect and arises where rules or practices have the appearance of neutrality but in fact lead to exclusions. This indirect discrimination often exists informally in attitudes and practices....</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Espionage or spying, is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information without the permission of the holder of the information. Spies help agencies uncover secret information. Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government, company or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome and in many cases illegal and punishable by law. Espionage is a method of intelligence gathering which includes information gathering from public sources.

 An ‘ethnic group’ has been defined as a group that regards itself or is regarded by others as a distinct community by virtue of certain characteristics that will help to distinguish the group from the surrounding community. Ethnicity is considered to be shared characteristics such as culture, language, religion, and traditions, which contribute to a person or group’s identity.

Ethnicity has been described as residing in:

• the belief by members of a social group that they are culturally distinctive and different to outsiders;

• their willingness to find symbolic markers of that difference (food habits, religion, forms of dress, language) and to emphasise their significance; and

• their willingness to organise relationships with outsiders so that a kind of ‘group boundary’ is preserved and reproduced</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual&apos;s physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one&apos;s perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial and/or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous. The forces applied may be various forms of forced migration (deportation, population transfer), intimidation, as well as genocide and genocidal rape.

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

To constitute genocide, there must be a proven intent on the part of perpetrators to physically destroy a national, [ethnic], racial or religious group.

...

In order for an economy to remain stable, it needs to have a healthy financial sector. This sector advances loans for businesses so they can expand, grants mortgages to homeowners, and issues insurance policies to protect people, companies, and their assets. It also helps build up savings for retirement....

The financial sector generates a good portion of its revenue from loans and mortgages. These gain value in an environment where interest rates drop. When rates are low, the economic conditions open up the doors for more capital projects and investment. When this happens, the financial sector benefits, meaning more economic growth.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>To illustrate how the government could try to use fiscal policy to affect the economy, consider an economy that&apos;s experiencing recession. The government might lower tax rates to increase aggregate demand and fuel economic growth; this is known as expansionary fiscal policy.

...

Rather than lowering taxes, the government might decide to increase spending. 

...

Expansionary fiscal policy is usually characterized by deficit spending, when government expenditures exceed receipts from taxes and other sources. In practice, deficit spending tends to result from a combination of tax cuts and higher spending.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The term &quot;freedom of expression&quot; is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that &quot;everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference&quot; and &quot;everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&quot;.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Health care or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals (providers or practitioners) in allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. Dentistry, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, pharmacy, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition_source>The military research laboratories have demonstrated that high power
microwave technologies can produce significant effects, ranging from upsetting
to destroying the electronics within military and commercial systems.
The Air Force has led this technology development, and various operational
communities, including the Air Combat Command and U.S. Strategic
Command, have identified numerous offensive and defensive requirements
that can be satisfied by high power microwave weapons.

Several high power microwave technologies have matured to the point
where they are now ready for the transition from engineering and manufacturing
development to deployment as operational weapons. The conclusion
of this study is that high power microwave technology is ready for the transition
to active weapons in the U.S. military. It reviews various applications of high power microwave weapons in strategic and operational missions for
the Air Force, considers the implications of the integration of microwave
technology into operational weapons, and examines numerous constraints
and challenges associated with the transition of new technologies and systems
into the Air Force inventory.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition_source>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Although more human beings stress available resources, population growth has also compounded the rate of innovation and technology development.  Human creativity is now clearly the most transformative force in the world, both enhancing human life, but also upending it, and – at times – precipitating catastrophic, disruptive events.  Information technology will continue to improve exponentially, and most of the developed world already is instrumented in some way.  Nearly every person on Earth has access to a connected, mobile device.  Advanced material capabilities have, and will continue to extend the trend of reduced size, weight, and power requirements, as nanomaterials, metamaterials, and bespoke structures allow multifunctional assemblies, vastly improving overall systems integration, reliability, and performance.  Advanced materials also foster increases in battery power and performance, allowing large amounts of power to be stored across a distributed grid, and miniaturized storage powers mobile robotics and vehicles of all types</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Singularity is the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds the collective intelligence of mankind, which will radically and irrevocably change the relationship between man and machine.  There are several divergent possibilities regarding the singularity: 

 As optimistic singularity advocates, such as Ray Kurzweil have suggested, AI improves human life in every way, from healthcare, to emotional evolution, to intergalactic space travel. 

 While not entirely apocalyptic, unboxed general artificial superintelligence improves and evolves at such an exponential rate it escapes human restrictions, perspectives, and morality.  It threatens the very existence of humanity. 

 Humans evolve their own cognitive abilities through learning developments, brain implants, artificial stimulants, and non-AI high performance computing to match, or at least keep pace with AI. 

AI has the capacity to change paradigms, revolutionize everyday life, and take mankind to exciting new horizons.  However, it also may be capable of incredible destruction, malice, and lines of thinking and decision-making that are dangerous to mankind.  This duality will be critical as actors develop military applications for AI.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>Social identity is the portion of an individual&apos;s self-concept derived from perceived membership in a relevant social group. As originally formulated by social psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner in the 1970s and the 1980s, social identity theory introduced the concept of a social identity as a way in which to explain intergroup behaviour.

Social identity theory is described as a theory that predicts certain intergroup behaviours on the basis of perceived group status differences, the perceived legitimacy and stability of those status differences, and the perceived ability to move from one group to another.

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>For many minorities and indigenous communities, the situation is critical. They face hate crimes, routinely high levels of discrimination, and even mass killing.  For others, long-term exclusion is trapping communities in poverty and threatening ways of life that have been sustained for generations – until now.

[These problems require] countering persecution and promoting inclusion. To the growth of hatred and intolerance we offer a vision based on defending rights and bringing communities together.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Human creativity is now clearly the most transformative force in the world, both enhancing human life, but also upending it, and – at times – precipitating catastrophic, disruptive events.  Information technology will continue to improve exponentially, and most of the developed world already is instrumented in some way.  Nearly every person on Earth has access to a connected, mobile device.  Advanced material capabilities have, and will continue to extend the trend of reduced size, weight, and power requirements, as nanomaterials, metamaterials, and bespoke structures allow multifunctional assemblies, vastly improving overall systems integration, reliability, and performance.  Advanced materials also foster increases in battery power and performance, allowing large amounts of power to be stored across a distributed grid, and miniaturized storage powers mobile robotics and vehicles of all types</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an increase in life expectancy was driven mainly by improvements in sanitation, housing, and education, causing a steady decline in early and mid-life mortality, which was chiefly due to infections. This trend continued with the development of vaccines and then antibiotics. By the latter half of the twentieth century, there was little room for further reduction in early and mid-life mortality. The continuing increase is due almost entirely to a new phenomenon: the decline in late-life mortality.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>The informal economy refers to companies that are engaged in legitimate business activities but don&apos;t fully comply with tax, labor market obligations, or product market regulations.

...

Around the world, these informal players operate at just half the average productivity level of formal companies in the same sectors and at a small fraction of the productivity of the best companies. As a result, informal companies persistently drag down a country&apos;s overall productivity and standard of living.

MGI&apos;s investigation also found that the substantial cost advantage that informal companies gain by avoiding taxes and regulations more than offsets their low productivity and small scale. Competition is therefore distorted because inefficient informal players stay in business and prevent more productive, formal companies from gaining market share.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>To understand the political behaviour in a country it is important to look at how that behaviour is enabled or constrained by informal institutions, and how this affects how formal institutions are run. For example, if there are high levels of extrajudicial killings in a country, it might be that while it is prohibited by the state the police are actually enabled to carry out such killings and informally encouraged to prop up an inefficient formal state police institution. An informal institution tends to have socially shared rules, which are unwritten and yet are often known by all inhabitants of a certain country, as such they are often referred to as being an inherent part of the culture of a given country. Informal practices are often referred to as &quot;cultural&quot;, for example clientelism or corruption is sometimes stated as a part of the political culture in a certain place, but an informal institution itself is not cultural, it may be shaped by culture or behaviour of a given political landscape, but they should be looked at in the same way as formal institutions to understand their role in a given country. Informal institutions might be particularly used to pursue a political agenda, or a course of action that might not be publicly popular, or even legal, and can be seen as an effective way of making up for lack of efficiency in a formal institution. For example, in countries where formal institutions are particularly inefficient, an informal institution may be the most cost effective way or actually carrying out a given task, and this ensures that there is little pressure on the formal institutions to become more efficient.The relationship between formal and informal institutions is often closely aligned and informal institutions step in to prop up inefficient institutions.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

In fact, government military forces rarely lose outright to insurgent military forces, and certainly not quickly.

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>nternational migration occurs when people cross state boundaries and stay in the host state for some minimum length of time. Migration occurs for many reasons. Many people leave their home countries in order to look for economic opportunities in another country. Others migrate to be with family members who have migrated or because of political conditions in their countries. Education is another reason for international migration, as students pursue their studies abroad. While there are several different potential systems for categorizing international migrants, one system organizes them into nine groups: temporary labour migrants; irregular, illegal, or undocumented migrants; highly skilled and business migrants; refugees; asylum seekers; forced migration; family members; return migrants; and long-term, low-skilled migrants. These migrants can also be divided into two large groups, permanent and temporary. Permanent migrants intend to establish their permanent residence in a new country and possibly obtain that country’s citizenship. Temporary migrants intend only to stay for a limited periods of time; perhaps until the end of a particular program of study or for the duration of a their work contract or a certain work season. Both types of migrants have a significant effect on the economies and societies of the chosen destination country and the country of origin.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>The judiciary (also known as the judicial system, judicial branch or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make statutory law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. However, in some countries the judiciary does make common law, setting precedent for other courts to follow. This branch of the state is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law. 

In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of judicial review. Courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm, such as primary legislation, the provisions of the constitution or international law. Judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus de facto in common law countries creating the body of constitutional law.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>&quot;Legislature&quot; is placed under &quot;DemocraticPolitics&quot; rather than constituting a category of it&apos;s own, like the other two branches of government, because the legislature has little importance outside a democracy.</obo:IAO_0000232>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(1)

A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments.

...

Laws enacted by legislatures are known as primary legislation. Legislatures observe and steer governing actions and usually have exclusive authority to amend the budget or budgets involved in the process.

The members of a legislature are called legislators. In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

Legislation (or &quot;statutory law&quot;) is law which has been promulgated (or &quot;enacted&quot;) by a legislature or other governing body or the process of making it. Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as &quot;legislation&quot;, while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict.

...

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, where upon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before passage. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given session. Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government. Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(1)

The term [&quot;manufacturing&quot;] is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other, more complex products, such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles, or sold to wholesalers, who in turn sell them to retailers, who then sell them to end users and consumers.

Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

Manufacturers create physical goods. How these goods are created varies depending on the specific company and industry. However, most manufacturers use machinery and industrial equipment to produce goods for public consumption. The manufacturing process creates value, meaning companies can charge a premium for what they create.

...

Today’s advancement of computer technology allows manufacturers to do more with less time. Now, thousands of items can be manufactured within the space of minutes. Computer technology can be used to assemble, test and track production. Each year, technology continues to make manufacturing increasingly efficient, faster and more cost-effective. However, automation also eliminates many manufacturing jobs, leaving skilled employees without work.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(3)

Manufacturing industries are broadly categorized into engineering industries, construction industries, electronics industries, chemical industries, energy industries, textile industries, food and beverage industries, metalworking industries, plastic industries, transport and telecommunication industries.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(1)

A megacity is a very large city metropolitan area, typically with a population of more than 10 million people.

...

A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that converge. The terms conurbation, metropolis, and metroplex are also applied to the latter. The term metacity has been used to describe metropolitan conurbations containing over 20 million people.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

Due to their high populations, megacities face several challenges. These challenges revolve around slums, crime, energy and material resources, homelessness, and traffic congestion. Slums are settlement areas which are characterized by improper housing facilities and poor sanitation. They have been caused by the rise in population and massive local and international immigration. Individuals who live in slums seldom receive access to proper education, healthcare, and housing. Slums are generally found in cities in developing countries. The rise of criminal activities due to discontentment of city residents is another limitation megacities face. A lack of fulfillment of basic needs such as food, water, and shelter can increase crime rates.

...

Megacities also face the challenge of managing limited energy and material resources such as electricity and water consumption, waste generation, transport energy, and steel production. There are many children and families who live on the streets in many megacities in spite of they many attempts by government and non-governmental organizations to end homelessness. The final challenge is traffic congestion which refers to transport delays that occur on the roads as a result of increase of use.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the legislature whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population&apos;s views. Proportional systems may have multi-member districts with more than one representative elected from a given district to the same legislative body, and thus a greater number of viable parties.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <hasInsights>What is Nationalism?
Nationalism is an ideology that emphasizes loyalty, devotion, or allegiance to a nation or nation-state and holds that such obligations outweigh other individual or group interests.
 
What is a nationalist movement?
A nationalist movement may be political or cultural or both. A political nationalist movement is a political, sometimes also military, struggle by a national group for statehood or for some measure of independence from or autonomy within a larger political association, such as another state or an empire. It may also be a struggle by a national group within its own nation-state for wider rights for its members, or it may be a (reactionary) struggle by such a national group against wider rights for minority groups.
 
How has nationalism been used?
Historically, nationalism was used in fascist regimes like those of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, who used the economic and political turmoil of the early 20th century to subjugate individualism to the needs of the nation by promoting national identity and tradition. Most notably perhaps is the nationalism exhibited during World War II by the Nazi party in Germany.</hasInsights>

        <hasTopicSummary>Nationalism is a political, social, and economic ideology and movement characterized by the promotion of the interests of a particular nation, especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation&apos;s sovereignty over its homeland.</hasTopicSummary>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power (popular sovereignty). It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity—based on shared social characteristics such as culture, language, religion, politics, and belief in a shared singular history—and to promote national unity or solidarity. Nationalism, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a nation&apos;s traditional culture, and cultural revivals have been associated with nationalist movements. It also encourages pride in national achievements, and is closely linked to patriotism.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

A pension may be a &quot;defined benefit plan&quot; where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a &quot;defined contribution plan&quot; under which a fixed sum is invested and then becomes available at retirement age. Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is usually paid in regular installments for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment prior to retirement.

The terms &quot;retirement plan&quot; and &quot;superannuation&quot; tend to refer to a pension granted upon retirement of the individual.

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Who is a refugee?

A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.

Who is an internally displaced person?

An internally displaced person, or IDP, is someone who has been forced to flee their home but never cross an international border. These individuals seek safety anywhere they can find it—in nearby towns, schools, settlements, internal camps, even forests and fields. IDPs, which include people displaced by internal strife and natural disasters, are the largest group that UNHCR assists.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

Though several international conventions reaffirm the right to self-determination, they also pledge to uphold the “principle of territorial integrity” — the right of existing states to prevent regions from seceding.

Self-determination is often interpreted to mean the right to secede and declare independence. But it can take other forms, too, such as local autonomy...or a federal system with a strong central government that protects minority rights.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Political repression is the persecution of an individual or group within society for political reasons, particularly for the purpose of restricting or preventing their ability to take part in the political life of a society thereby reducing their standing among their fellow citizens.

...

It often is manifested through discriminatory policies, such as human rights violations, surveillance abuse, police brutality, imprisonment, involuntary settlement, stripping of citizen&apos;s rights, lustration and violent action or terror such as the murder, summary executions, torture, forced disappearance and other extrajudicial punishment of political activists, dissidents, or general population. Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership and by self-censorship within the public.

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute state terrorism, genocide, politicide or crimes against humanity. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes. Acts of political repression may be carried out by secret police forces, army, paramilitary groups or death squads.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be the most disruptive technology of our time: much of today’s “thought” is artificial, vice human.  Breakthroughs in AI and deep learning enable reasoning intelligent systems that, though not sentient, administer and optimize a great many aspects of modern life.  Advanced physio-mechanical interfaces enable humanmachine integration to include optimized searching of massive indexes of data, direct access to large-scale computing power, and life-like experiences through virtual reality. The revolutionary impact of “trans-humanism” challenges the very definition of “human” – with profound ethical dilemmas that remain unresolved. Big data techniques interrogate massive databases to discover hidden patterns and correlations that form the basis of modern advertising – and are continually leveraged for intelligence and security purposes by nation states and non-state entities alike.  Quantum computing, first applied to encryption functions, is now a key computing enabler, especially for artificial intelligence.9  A mature Internet of Things connects and integrates the devices of the information realm with formerly inert objects – structures, motors, or appliances -- of the physical realm.  Neuroscience has enhanced our understanding of brain function, including neural plasticity, and has enabled advanced techniques for human-machine interfacing. A better understanding of the machinery of the mind has found commercial application in the acceleration of speed and retention in learning.  In the most connected and wealthy parts of the world, cell phones and computers will all but disappear as physical, hand held devices.  Select individuals will directly connect to cyberspace through neural implants or augmented reality systems painted directly on a retina.  If we have not yet reached the “singularity”, where AI and machines are capable of outperforming the human mind, we will nonetheless have reached a point where AI, machines, and man-machine teaming open new possibilities in this realm.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(1)

In general, the rule of law implies that the creation of laws, their enforcement, and the relationships among legal rules are themselves legally regulated, so that no one—including the most highly placed official—is above the law. The legal constraint on rulers means that the government is subject to existing laws as much as its citizens are. Thus, a closely related notion is the idea of equality before the law, which holds that no “legal” person shall enjoy privileges that are not extended to all and that no person shall be immune from legal sanctions.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>(2)

Judicial independence means that judges are independent from political pressures and influences when they make their decisions. An independent judiciary is essential to maintaining the rule of law. Judges should not be pressured by a political party, a private interest, or popular opinion when they are called upon to determine what the law requires. Keeping the judiciary independent of these influences ensures that everyone has a fair chance to make their case in court and that judges will be impartial in making their decisions. Judges also must explain their decisions in public written opinions, and their decisions can be appealed to a higher court for review. These elements of judicial decision- making ensure that judges remain accountable to the rule of law.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <obo:IAO_0000232>National security is the security of a nation state, including its citizens, economy, and institutions, which is regarded as a duty of government.

Originally conceived as protection against military attack, national security is now widely understood to include non-military dimensions, including the security from terrorism, crime, economic security, energy security, environmental security, food security, cyber security etc. Similarly, national security risks include, in addition to the actions of other nation states, action by violent non-state actors, narcotic cartels, and multinational corporations, and also the effects of natural disasters.

Governments rely on a range of measures, including political, economic, and military power, as well as diplomacy to enforce national security. They may also act to build the conditions of security regionally and internationally by reducing transnational causes of insecurity, such as climate change, economic inequality, political exclusion, and nuclear proliferation.

Sometimes called a squatter, or spontaneous settlement, a typical shanty town often lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity, hygienic streets, or other basic necessities to support human settlements.

Shanty towns are mostly found in developing nations....

Since construction is informal and unguided by urban planning, there is typically no formal street grid, house numbers, or named streets. Such settlements also lack some or all basic public services such as a sewage network, electricity, safe running water, rain water drainage, garbage removal, access to public transport, or insect and disease control services. Even if these resources are present, they are likely to be disorganized, unreliable, and poorly maintained. Shanty towns also tend to lack basic services present in more formally organized settlements, including policing, mail delivery, medical services, and fire fighting.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

The System Orchestrator role provides system requirements, high-level design, and monitoring for the data system. While the role predates Big Data systems, some related design activities have changed within the Big Data paradigm.

The System Orchestrator role includes defining and integrating the required data application activities into an operational vertical system. Typically, the System Orchestrator involves a collection of more specific roles, performed by one or more actors, which manage and orchestrate the operation of the Big Data system. These actors may be human components, software components, or some combination of the two. The function of the System Orchestrator is to configure and manage the other components of the Big Data architecture to implement one or more workloads that the architecture is designed to execute. The workloads managed by the System Orchestrator may be assigning/provisioning framework components to individual physical or virtual nodes at the lower level, or providing a graphical user interface that supports the specification of workflows linking together multiple applications and components at the higher level. The System Orchestrator may also, through the Management Fabric, monitor the workloads and system to confirm that specific quality of service requirements are met for each workload, and may actually elastically assign and provision additional physical or virtual resources to meet workload requirements resulting from changes/surges in the data or number of users/transactions.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

...

Even without the constraints imposed by most-favoured-nation and national treatment clauses, sometimes general multilateral agreements are easier to reach than separate bilateral agreements. In many cases the possible loss from a concession to one country is almost as great as that which would result from a similar concession to many countries. The gains that the most efficient producers realize from worldwide tariff reductions are large enough to warrant substantial concessions.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A two-party system is a party system where two major political parties dominate the government. One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority or governing party while the other is the minority or opposition party. Around the world, the term has different senses. [In some countries], the sense of two-party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties, and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature. In such arrangements, two-party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner-takes-all election rules. In such systems, while chances for third-party candidates winning election to major national office are remote, it is possible for groups within the larger parties, or in opposition to one or both of them, to exert influence on the two major parties. In contrast, in [some] parliamentary systems and elsewhere, the term two-party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature, and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Urbanization is when people move from rural farmland to cities and towns. Rural areas are more densely packed and offer greater opportunities to their residents in the form of higher paying jobs and a larger variety of job opportunities.

Most developing countries experience the process of urbanization, especially once they start becoming industrialized. Cities and towns become hubs of trade and culture, and more people start moving out of the country to gain access to some of these social and financial benefits.

Urbanization is a natural part of developing society, but it has its downside as well. As populations in cities and towns rise, they expand and eventually invade rural areas. We need to strike a balance with urbanization if we want to flourish as a society.

...

Urban areas have more jobs to offer and can lure people out of rural areas with the promise of a better life and a higher-paying salary. People find more jobs in virtually every industry while looking in cities and towns than they do searching rural locations.

There are more people in urban areas, which means there is more demand. The increased demand opens the door to employment opportunities for a lot of people who can’t find a job in their rural hometown.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.ontologylibrary.mil/OperationalEnvironment/Mid/OEFutureWarfareOntology#EconomicsAndTrade"/>
        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Welfare state, concept of government in which the state or a well-established network of social institutions plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. The general term may cover a variety of forms of economic and social organization.

A fundamental feature of the welfare state is social insurance, a provision common to most advanced industrialized countries.... Such insurance is usually financed by compulsory contributions and is intended to provide benefits to persons and families during periods of greatest need. It is widely recognized, however, that in practice the cash benefits fall considerably short of the levels intended by the designers of the plans.

The welfare state also usually includes public provision of basic education, health services, and housing (in some cases at low cost or without charge).

...

Antipoverty programs and the system of personal taxation may also be regarded as aspects of the welfare state. Personal taxation falls into this category insofar as its progressivity is used to achieve greater justice in income distribution (rather than merely to raise revenue) and also insofar as it used to finance social insurance payments and other benefits not completely financed by compulsory contributions. In socialist countries the welfare state also covers employment and administration of consumer prices.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Fault Lines Analysis provides the command with an understanding of the most exploitable sources of instability in the OE. The Fault Lines Analysis Methodology is based on co-created analysis:  research and analysis conducted as a team. There are 3 distinct stages to the team research and analysis process:  Analysis 1 (A1), Analysis (A2), and Analysis 3 (A3). A1 reviews and develops categories from source text by assigning relevant words, phrases or labels to significant portions of the text.  These categories become the foundation for early analysis.  A2 organizes the categories around themes based on the relationship of ideas developed from the comparisons and analytic memos. A3 generates plausible explanations and responses to the research question (becoming assumptions or hypotheses tested in the next stage).  Each analysis stage builds on the analysis of the previous stage(s). The evolution of sound analytic explanation occurs through a systematic and defensible inductive research process. The independent stages are inductively generated to be later deductively tested by a pool of SMEs in an OE.  GCKN is available to assist with the research process.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

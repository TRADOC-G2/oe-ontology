8/8/2018 Updates:

Files Added:
OEAnalysisFrameworkOntology.owl-This was created to replace the PMESII and DIMEFIL ontologies and allow for an easier way to group analysis together
bfo.owl-This was added to replace bfo_classes_only.owl so a complete version of BFO is available. This will help for others who use complete versions of BFO to import the OE Ontology files seamlessly 

Files Removed:
OE_TaskData.owl-There were inconsistencies with the data and the conversion process, so this file was removed
bfo_classes_only.owl-Replaced with bfo.owl
OEDimefilOntology.owl-Became part of OEAnalysisFrameworkOntology.owl
OEPmesiipt.owl-Became part of OEAnalysisFrameworkOntology.owl

Files Renamed:

Most battalions range in size between 500 and 800 Soldiers, although some sustainment battalions are larger. Most maneuver battalions are organized by branch, arm, or service and, in addition to their line companies, contain a headquarters company. Combined
arms battalions are exceptions to this rule, in that they contain two mechanized infantry companies and two armor companies. Typically, battalions have three to five companies in addition to their headquarters.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A brigade is a unit consisting of two or more battalions and a headquarters company or detachment. A brigade normally contains between 2,500 to 5,000 Soldiers. Its capacity for independent action varies by its type. Division commanders use armored, infantry, or Stryker brigade combat teams, supported by multifunctional support brigades—fires brigades, combat aviation brigades, maneuver enhancement brigades (MEBs), battlefield surveillance brigades, and sustainment brigades—and functional brigades, such as air and missile defense brigades, engineer brigades, civil affairs brigades, and military police brigades, to accomplish their assigned missions. Sustainment brigades are normally assigned to the theater sustainment command and provide support to other Army units, usually on an area basis.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A brigade combat team is a combined arms organization consisting of a brigade headquarters, at least two maneuver battalions, and necessary supporting functional capabilities. BCTs are the largest fixed tactical units in the Army. However, additional battalions and companies may be attached to them or their organic battalions, and companies can be detached from them as part of force tailoring at the strategic and operational levels and task organization at the tactical level as required by the mission variables of METT-TC. Infantry and armored BCTs normally include a fires battalion, a brigade support battalion, and a brigade special troops battalion in addition to their two maneuver battalions and a reconnaissance squadron. Stryker BCTs do not have a brigade special troops battalion. They have separate functional companies. They also have a third maneuver battalion and a fires battalion. BCTs combine the efforts of their battalions and companies to fight engagements and perform tactical tasks within division-level battles and major operations. Their chief tactical responsibility is synchronizing the plans and actions of their subordinate units to accomplish assigned tasks for a division headquarters.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>A company is a unit consisting of two or more platoons, usually of the same type, with a headquarters and a limited capacity for self-support. A troop is a company-size unit in a reconnaissance organization. A battery is a company-size unit in a fires or air defense artillery battalion. A company normally consists of more than 75 soldiers. Some aviation and armor companies are exceptions to this rule. Companies and air defense and artillery batteries are the basic elements of battalions. Companies, batteries, and troops may also be assigned as separate units of brigades and larger organizations. Some companies, such as special forces companies, have subordinate detachments, instead of platoons, which are organized and trained to operate independently for extended periods.

Company-size combat units can fight in mass or by subordinate platoons. Reconnaissance troops frequently operate with their platoons in separate areas. In combined arms battalions, companies fight either as integral units or as task-organized teams reinforced with close-combat platoons of the same or different types.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

These company teams can include other supporting squads or platoons, such as engineers. Company teams are task-organized for specific missions. Such teams can match capabilities to missions with greater precision than units using only organic platoons. However, the attachment of different units at the company
level demands thorough training to achieve the maximum complementary effects. Whenever possible, platoons and detachments should train together before they are committed.</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>

        <CommonCoreOntologies:definition>Army Regulation (AR) 600-82 defines a regiment as a single or a group of like-type combat arms or training units authorized a regimental color. (The term “combat arms” is a rescinded doctrinal term, but it still exists in Army regulations.) Traditionally, a regiment was a fixed tactical unit with organic combat battalions and supply and support organizations. The Army currently retains only one traditional tactical regiment, the 75th Rangers. All of the Army’s other regiments have no tactical function. Instead, they are intended to perpetuate regimental history, espirit de corps, and traditions for Soldiers affiliated with a regiment. Many of the Army’s branches contain only a single regiment, such as the Corps of Engineers and the Military Police Corps. Each maneuver battalion or squadron carries an association with a parent regiment. In some BCTs and brigades several numbered battalions carrying the same regimental association serve together, and tend to consider themselves part of the traditional regiment, when in fact they are independent battalions serving a brigade, rather than a regimental headquarters. For example, some BCTs, such as the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, bear the title of cavalry regiments for historical purposes</CommonCoreOntologies:definition>
